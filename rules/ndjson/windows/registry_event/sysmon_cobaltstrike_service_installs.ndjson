{"description":"Detects known malicious service installs that appear in cases in which a Cobalt Strike beacon elevates privileges or lateral movement. We can also catch this by system log 7045 (https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/win_cobaltstrike_service_installs.yml) In some SIEM you can catch those events also in HKLM\\System\\ControlSet001\\Services or HKLM\\System\\ControlSet002\\Services, however, this rule is based on a regular sysmon's events.
