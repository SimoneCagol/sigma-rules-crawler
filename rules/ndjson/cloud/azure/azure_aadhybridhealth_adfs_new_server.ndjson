{"description":"This detection uses AzureActivity logs (Administrative category) to identify the creation or update of a server instance in an Azure AD Hybrid health AD FS service.\nA threat actor can create a new AD Health ADFS service and create a fake server instance to spoof AD FS signing logs. There is no need to compromise an on-prem AD FS server.\nThis can be done programmatically via HTTP requests to Azure.\n Author: Roberto Rodriguez (Cyb3rWard0g), OTR (Open Threat Research), MSTIC.
