{"description":"This detection uses AzureActivity logs (Administrative category) to identify the deletion of an Azure AD Hybrid health AD FS service instance in a tenant.\nA threat actor can create a new AD Health ADFS service and create a fake server to spoof AD FS signing logs.\nThe health AD FS service can then be deleted after it is not longer needed via HTTP requests to Azure.\n Author: Roberto Rodriguez (Cyb3rWard0g), OTR (Open Threat Research), MSTIC.
